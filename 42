The function returns s, which is declared on the stack of this function. Were it not
static, it would go out of scope, effectively disappear, once the function returns









because all the storage on the stack is made available for reuse once a function returns. 
By making it static, it’s forced to have a persistent address in memory. However, it’s 
still bad design - if you call this function from multiple threads, they’ll fight with 
each other for use of the static memory space.
